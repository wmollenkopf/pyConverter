# Simple Python PySimpleGUI Converter

Just a VERY simple Python application using PySimpleGUI.
The project is meant to help practice very basic and simple projects, as well as concepts within Python that I may be rusty or unfamiliar with.

If you're using Debian/Ubuntu based OS, you'll need to run the following:
```
sudo apt-get install python-tk python3-tk tk-dev
pip install PySimpleGUI
```
